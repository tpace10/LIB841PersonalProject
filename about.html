            <p>Welcome parents and students, let me introduce myself. My name is Tiffany Pace. I am an alumni of our school district; I graduated in 2012 from Wayne County High School. I am married, my husband, Tyler, teaches 8th grade History here in our district. We have four children, Thomas (age 11), Tessa (age 7), Taylor (age 2), and Tucker (8 months). This is my fourth year teaching fourth grade in our district. I enjoy reading, crocheting, kayaking, spending time with and playing video games with my family.</p>

            <p>I am passionate about teaching. I believe that every student has a right to an appropriate and challenging education that helps them reach their full potential. The purpose of an educator is to provide this education for all students. I believe that students should be given hands-on opportunities to practice and apply what they are learning. Students should be challenged and not held back if they are excelling at the regular curriculum; likewise, students that are struggling should be given more support in a timely and individualized manner. Students need to be encouraged to work harder and grow; hard work should be praised and appreciated. Students should learn growth mindsets to recognize difficult tasks as abilities to grow academically instead of opportunities to fail. I am determined to provide all of my students with an education that helps them reach their full potential.</p>
